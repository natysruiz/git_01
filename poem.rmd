In a cupboard small, beneath the stair,

Lived a boy with messy, untamed hair.

He knew not magic, nor of his fame,

Till Hogwarts sent a letter in his name.

A wand of holly, a scar like a flash,

Marking the day of a dark night’s clash.

With Ron and Hermione by his side,

Into the wizarding world, he'd stride.

Through halls of stone, and spells that sing,

He’d face the Dark Lord, rise as a king.

The Sorting Hat, it chose his fate,

In Gryffindor's warmth, his heart would wait.

Quidditch games and broomsticks high,

Flying fast across the sky.

A hidden chamber, a serpent's bite,

He faced the dark but held the light.

In shadows deep, and darkened hall,

He sought the truth, he’d give his all.

Dementors cold, and fires that gleam,

Through every year, a haunting dream.

Prophecies whispered, and secrets spun,

He was the boy who would never run.

Through trials fierce, through loss and pain,

In the end, the light would reign.

Voldemort’s fall, the wand of might,

The world reclaimed, set things right.

The Boy Who Lived, with courage true,

His story ends, but magic grew.
